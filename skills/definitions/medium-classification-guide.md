# Medium Classification Guide

## Overview

This guide enables 3-step classification of artwork into specific techniques:

1. **Step 1: Art Medium** (17 broad categories) - What type of medium does this look like?
2. **Step 2: Subcategory** (varies) - Within that medium, what specific subcategory?
3. **Step 3: Technique** (5 per subcategory) - What specific technique within that subcategory?
