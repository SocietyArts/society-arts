## AMD001 - Bold Paint (Oil/Acrylic)

### Definition
Traditional painting techniques using opaque oil or acrylic paints, characterized by visible brushwork, rich color saturation, and textured surfaces. This category captures the classic fine art painting aesthetic from Renaissance masters to contemporary expressionists.

### Visual Characteristics
- **Brushstrokes**: Clearly visible, directional brush marks showing paint application
- **Texture**: Physical paint buildup (impasto), canvas weave may show through
- **Color**: Rich, saturated, opaque coverage; colors can be blended on surface
- **Edges**: Varies from soft blended to sharp defined, but with painterly quality
- **Surface**: Appears to have physical depth and texture, not flat
- **Finish**: Can range from matte to glossy depending on medium

### ✓ IS This Category If:
- Visible brushstrokes show direction and energy of paint application
- Paint appears thick and opaque with full coverage
- Canvas or painting surface texture is evident
- Color mixing appears to happen on the surface
- Has the "weight" and presence of traditional painting
- Impasto technique visible (thick paint standing up from surface)
- Brush hair marks or palette knife edges visible
- Colors have the richness of pigment-based paint

### ✗ NOT This Category If:
- Colors appear translucent or watery (→ AMD002 Watercolor)
- Surface is perfectly flat with no texture (→ AMD003 Flat Paint or Digital)
- Image has photographic quality with real-world detail (→ AMD007 Photography)
- Lines are drawn rather than painted (→ AMD004-006 Drawing categories)
- Gradients are perfectly smooth without brush texture (→ Digital Art)
- Has the flat, graphic quality of poster art (→ AMD003 or AMD011)

### Edge Cases
- **Digital paintings mimicking oil**: Classify as AMD001 if the intent and appearance match oil painting aesthetic. Users searching for "oil painting style" should find these.
- **Very loose/abstract expressionism**: Still AMD001 if paint texture and brushwork evident
- **Photorealistic painting**: AMD001 if any paint texture visible; if indistinguishable from photo, note low confidence

### Common Subjects
Portraits, landscapes, still life, figurative work, abstract expressionism, impressionist scenes, classical compositions
